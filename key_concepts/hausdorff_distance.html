      <h1><strong>Hausdorff distance</strong></h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Let's formally define the Hausdorff distance. </p>
      <p>Here is the definition of the directed Hausdorff distance between two sets of points. It is defined as the maximum distance of a point in one set to the closest point in the other set. It makes more sense seeing it as math : </p> 
      <img src="../images/equation/hausdorff_eq.png" class="center" alt="Hausdorff equation">
      Where d(a,b) is the Euclidian distance between two points.</p>
      <p>To make it more general, we can define the undirected Hausdorff distance, which is the maximum between the two directed Hausdorff distances. </p>

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <h3>Brute force</h3>
        <p>A simple brute force algorithm for that would look something like this :</p>

          <h4>Complexity</h4>
          <p>To find the directed distance, such an algorithm runs in O(nm)+O(n)=O(nm). 
            That needs to be performed two times to get the undirected distance.</p>
        
        <h3>ATALLAH algorithm</h3>
        <p>In 1983, Mikhail J. Atallah proposed an algorithm  for convex shapes that runs in linear time : O(n+m).  </p>
        <p>The proof is based on 3 lemmas :</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Lemma 1 </strong>: Let d(x, y) = D(A, B), where x is a point
            of A and y is a point of B. Then 
            <ul><li>(i) the perpendicular to xy at x is a supporting 
            line of A, and A is on the same side as B relative to
            that supporting line, and</li>
            <li>(ii) the perpendicular to xy at y is a supporting
            line of B, and x and B are on different sides relative
            to that line.</li></ul></li>
            <img src="../images/proof.png" width="85%">
          <li><strong>Lemma 2 </strong>: There is a vertex x of A such that the
            distance from x to B is equal to D(A, B). </li>
          <li><strong>Lemma 3 </strong>: The scan σ changes direction exactly twice. </li>
          <p>The scan is performed in that way : for a vertex 
            vk of A, we draw a line vk yk (yk is either a vertex of B or a point on an edge of B perpendicular to the edge). 
            If the next point vk+1 is to the left of vk yk, we scan B counterclockwise, otherwise we scan it clockwise. Because the 
            shape is convex, the 3rd lemma makes sense. The idea of the algo resides on that last lemma.
            It guarantees that the repetitive execution of Step 2 will not
            cause polygon B to be ‘scanned’ more than twice.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h4>The algo</h4>

        <p>Step 1. Computer do and find y. (this can clearly
          be done in O(m) time). Set D(A, B) + d,
          and k + 0.</p>
        <p>Step 2 (finding yk + , )
          Case 1. vk+, is to the left of ykvk: Search for
          yk + 1 by ‘scanning’ polygon B counterclockwise,
          starting at y,., until one of the following two
          conditions is satisfied:
          (i) The edge of B being considered (call it
          w,w,+,) is such that the foot (call it z) of the
          perpendicular from vk+, to WOWS+1 is between
          wq and w,+,. In this case set yk+ , + z.
          (ii) The vertex of B being considered (call it
          w4) is such that the perpendicular to vL+,wq at
          ws is a supporting line of B. In this case set
          Ykt, ‘WC,.
          Case 2. vk+, is to the right of ykvk: This case
          is similar to Case 1, except that the search for
          yk + , is done by ‘scanning’ polygon B clockwise,
          starting at yk.
          Case 3. vk+, is on ykvk (but not necessarily
          between yk and vk): Set yk+, + yk.</p>
          <p>Step 3. Set
          D(A, B) +max{D(A, B), d(vk+,, Ye+,)}
          and k + k + 1 mod n. If k f 0, then go to
          Step 2, otherwise stop.</p>
