The project will explore "Between shapes, using the 
Hausdorff distance," [22] 
focusing on understanding and implementing the concept 
of interpolating shapes 
using Hausdorff distance as a metric. Hausdorff distance
 measures how far two subsets of a 
metric space are from each other, making it useful for 
comparing shapes 
in computational geometry. 
The article addresses a specific problem : given
 two shapes A and B with a
Hausdorff distance of 1, 
there exists a shape S that lies halfway in terms of 
this distance, at 0.5, from both A and B. This 
project will delve into the algorith- mic
 approach to finding this intermediary 
shape and investigate 
its characteristics based on the properties (such 
as convexity or connectedness) of A and B. 
Additionally, I will explore the genera- lization 
of this approach to interpolate between 
multiple shapes, 
offering insights into the concept of a "Hausdorff 
middle" for more than two input sets. 
This study aims to 
illustrate the application of Hausdorff distance 
in shape interpolation and to visualize 
the results through computational models.
