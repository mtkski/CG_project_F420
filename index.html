      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
      <p>The Hausdorff distance is a metric used mainly in computer 
        vision and computational geometry to assess the similarity 
        between two objects (set 
        of points or polygons for example). Imagine two shapes at a H distance of 1. 
        Now imagine what could be the shape that sits exactly in the 
        middle of them, what is the shape that has the same Hausdorff 
        distance to A and to B ? Does an intermediate shape like that 
        always exists ? Is is convex, correct ? How can we interpolate 
        such shape ? This work will address this issue and go further by 
        generalizing this concept.</p>
